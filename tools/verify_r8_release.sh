# Verify the release build against the Google Play technical requirements.

# Run this after touching dependencies, keep rules, the native runtime, or
# anything that changes what R8 can see. It answers four questions that are
# otherwise only answerable by rendering an HTML report in a browser and
# squinting at it:
#
#   1. Does Play's 25% optimization/obfuscation/shrinking floor apply, and if
#      so is it met?   (enforced from February 2027, for bundles > 10 MB DEX)
#   2. Is the packaged APK 16 KB page-size aligned?   (required for API 35+)
#   3. Did R8 preserve the classes the native runtime resolves by name at
#      JNI_OnLoad? A rename here is a release-only UnsatisfiedLinkError.
#   4. Is anything unsigned or missing from the bundle?
#
# Usage: tools/verify_r8_release.sh [variant]   (default: free)
