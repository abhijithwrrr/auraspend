# inaccurate licence claim is a real compliance problem rather than a cosmetic
# one, so it gets a mechanical check.

# two lines that were both correct: the sentence describing the *model's* licence
# (a third party, permissively licensed, and required to be stated accurately) and
# the historical note that AuraSpend *was* Apache-2.0 up to 0.1.0 (which the terms
# of service have to record). So the check is line-scoped, and a line is exempt
# when it carries a marker explaining why an Apache mention is legitimate.
# Failures print the offending line, because "it failed" is not actionable.
