## On-Device AI (Local Categorization)

AuraSpend can run a small, fully-on-device model to improve message
auto-categorization into **subscriptions, categories, income, expense and other**.

- **22 MB, not 400 MB.** The model is a quantised `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` sentence
  **encoder** (int8, ONNX), Apache-2.0 licensed. Downloaded at runtime from
  HuggingFace after user consent, and SHA-256 verified before it is allowed
  anywhere near the models directory.
- **Why an encoder, not a language model.** The job is a closed-vocabulary
  decision over a bank SMS, not text generation. Five runtimes were measured
  through the production pipeline; a 468 MB Qwen-0.5B decoder *deleted* 8 of 46
  real transactions because it mistook them for OTPs, and the 22 MB encoder
  deletes **none**. The measured table is in
  [`docs/evals/README.md`](docs/evals/README.md).
- **Consent first**: the first time you open **Smart Add**, the app offers to add
  the categoriser (a 22 MB download, so it is an inline offer rather than a modal
  dialog). Accepting starts a **background download** (resumable, cancellable) to
  internal storage — nothing leaves the device.
- **Progress everywhere**: the download progress is shown **in-app** (Smart Add banner + Settings card) **and in a
  system notification** that updates live and clears when the download finishes.
- **A gap-filler, never a gatekeeper**: amount / merchant / date come from the
  battle-tested regex parser (`BankMessageParser`), and the model fills only the
  gaps it left — *subscription detection, category selection, income-vs-expense*.
  On any conflict the parser's answer wins. A model may never discard a
  transaction on its own: `AiSignalFusion` requires both a calibrated probability
  *and* that the parser found no amount, because a false veto **deletes** a real
  debit rather than mis-filing it. If the model isn't downloaded, the app
  transparently falls back to the pure regex classifier, so nothing breaks.
- **Sender-routed bank parsers**: the SMS sender ID selects a hand-written parser
  for that bank's exact format (Axis, Canara, SBI), which is what resolves
  messages carrying both a real amount and a decoy available-limit figure.
- **Unreadable messages are surfaced, not dropped**: a bank SMS carrying an amount
  and a movement word that no parser can read is recorded so it can be filed by
  hand, rather than silently vanishing from your history.
- **Learned classification memory**: every save (manual or auto) records a normalized
  merchant/note → category mapping in a local Room table (`classification_memory`). Repeat
  merchants are categorized **instantly** — the model is skipped entirely — and your manual
  corrections always win over automated suggestions. Stored in `classification_memory`, migrated
  safely from previous schema versions (v5 → v6).
- **Multi-signal fusion** (`AiSignalFusion`): a calibrated "not a transaction" probability
  may null out a message only when it is ≥ 0.9 **and** the regex layer found no amount —
  confidence alone is never licence to discard; explicit *credited/debited* keywords beat a
  model type guess on conflict; recurring-payment keywords (auto-debit, NACH, renewal…) force
  subscription classification even without the model; confidence rises when signals agree and
  drops when they conflict.
- **Manage it**: the **Smart categories** card in Settings shows status and lets
  you download, cancel and delete the model.

### Build prerequisites

No native toolchain is needed. Inference runs on **ONNX Runtime**, a Maven AAR
rather than a compiled C++ module, so a stock JDK and the Android SDK are
sufficient — the NDK/CMake requirement of earlier releases is gone along with
`llama-lib/`.

### Toolchain

| Component | Version |
|-----------|---------|
| Gradle    | 9.5.0   |
| AGP       | 9.3.1 (built-in Kotlin, KGP 2.2.10) |
| Kotlin / Compose compiler | 2.2.10 |
| compileSdk / targetSdk    | 37 |
| minSdk    | 30 |
| R8        | Full mode (minify + optimize + obfuscate + resource shrinking) |

```bash
# no submodule to fetch - the native runtime is a Maven AAR
./gradlew assembleDevDebug
```

The model is Apache-2.0 licensed (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`). It is downloaded at
runtime from HuggingFace after user consent, and its SHA-256 is verified before
use.

## Build Flavors

Two environments, one feature set. `dev` exists so a development build can sit
next to the store build on one device; `prod` is what ships.

| Flavor | Command | Use Case |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `dev`  | `./gradlew assembleDevDebug` | Development / QA — id `.dev`, label "AuraSpend Dev" |
| `prod` | `./gradlew assembleProdDebug` | The store build (`com.awbuilds.auraspend`) |

**Every feature is available in both flavors, and neither build carries
analytics or ads.** AuraSpend has no paywall, no tracking and no ad SDKs — the
claim that your bank SMS never leaves your phone is true of every build we
publish.

The flavors change configuration only — application-id suffix, label and
signing. **No feature may live in a flavor source set that is absent from
`app/src/main/`** — see [ADR 0007](docs/adr/0007-no-paywall.md),
[ADR 0008](docs/adr/0008-distribution-flavors.md) and
[ADR 0010](docs/adr/0010-dev-prod-flavors.md).

### Building a release

```bash
./gradlew assembleProdRelease    # prod APK (self-install / GitHub Releases / website)
./gradlew bundleProdRelease      # prod AAB (Play Store)
```

Release builds require a keystore in `secrets.properties` (see
`secrets.properties.example`). **Without it the build still succeeds but
produces an `…-unsigned.apk`**, which Play and self-installers will reject —
check the filename before uploading.

Pushing a `v*` tag runs the release workflow, which builds both, verifies the
signatures, and attaches them to a GitHub Release as
`AuraSpend-V<version>.Alpha.{aab,apk}` — see
`.github/workflows/release.yml`. It never uploads to Play.

### Google Drive backup

Drive backup is optional and user-owned in every build: the backup lives in
**your own Google Drive**, and the project operates no servers and never sees
it.

- **Installed from Google Play** — sign in with your Google account; the
  Play-signed build is registered for Drive sign-in, so this works out of the
  box.
- **Self-built** — Google Sign-In authorizes against an OAuth client
  registered for the app's package id **and signing certificate**, so a build
  signed with your own key needs its own OAuth client in a Google Cloud
  project (type *Android*, your package id + your signing SHA-1). Your backup
  still goes to your own Drive.
- **No Google account?** CSV export/import works in every build without any
  Google service — Settings → Data.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Kotlin
- **UI**: Jetpack Compose + Material 3 (Expressive), Aurora design system (`ui/designsystem`)
- **Typography**: Plus Jakarta Sans (bundled, variable) with tabular figures for money
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture + MVI (Unidirectional data flow)
- **DI**: Manual (Application class) — no Hilt/Koin
- **Local Storage**: Room Database (indexed; SQL aggregates; Paging 3)
- **Charts**: Canvas-based, animated (no external charting library)
- **Cloud**: Google Drive API v3
- **Localization**: English + Hindi (`values-hi`), full string resources
- **Performance**: baseline-profile-ready, Macrobenchmark module (`:benchmark`)
- **Target SDK**: Android 17 (API 37)
- **Min SDK**: Android 11 (API 30)

```

The `dev` and `prod` source sets deliberately contain **no Kotlin**. Every
feature lives in `main`, so both flavors are identical apart from the dev
app-id suffix, label and signing — see
[ADR 0008](docs/adr/0008-distribution-flavors.md) and
[ADR 0010](docs/adr/0010-dev-prod-flavors.md).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio Koala or newer
- JDK 17+
- Android SDK 37

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/auraspend/auraspend.git
cd auraspend
cp secrets.properties.example secrets.properties
```

`secrets.properties` only matters for signed release builds — fill in the four
keystore values (see the comments in the template). Debug builds work without
it.

Build and run:

```bash
./gradlew assembleDevDebug
```

**First launch**: The app auto-seeds 12 default categories and shows the onboarding screen.

## Preview

| Home | Quick Add | Activity |
|---|---|---|
| ![Home](docs/screenshots/home-light.png) | ![Quick Add](docs/screenshots/quick-add.png) | ![Activity](docs/screenshots/activity.png) |

| Transaction detail | Insights | Savings goals |
|---|---|---|
| ![Transaction detail](docs/screenshots/transaction-detail.png) | ![Insights](docs/screenshots/insights.png) | ![Goals](docs/screenshots/goals.png) |

| Onboarding | Dark theme | AMOLED settings |
|---|---|---|
| ![Onboarding](docs/screenshots/onboarding.png) | ![Home dark](docs/screenshots/home-dark.png) | ![Settings](docs/screenshots/settings.png) |

The UI is built on the **Aurora design system** (`app/src/main/java/com/awbuilds/auraspend/ui/designsystem`):
brand purple + lavender + teal, Plus Jakarta Sans with tabular figures, hairline
borders instead of shadows, spring motion tokens and a light / dark / true-black
AMOLED theme. Screenshots are from the dev debug build.

## Testing

```bash
# Unit tests (JVM) — includes Robolectric + Roborazzi screenshot tests
./gradlew testProdDebugUnitTest

# Aurora screenshot baselines live in app/src/test/screenshots and are
# regenerated by the test run; CI fails if they change without being committed.

# Instrumented tests (requires emulator/device)
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest

# Cold-start macrobenchmark (release build, requires a device + the release
# keystore in secrets.properties)
./gradlew :benchmark:connectedProdBenchmarkAndroidTest

# Generate a baseline profile (requires a device; copy the produced
# baseline-prof.txt to app/src/main/baseline-prof.txt and commit)
./gradlew :benchmark:connectedProdBenchmarkAndroidTest \
  -Pandroid.testInstrumentationRunnerArguments.class=com.awbuilds.auraspend.benchmark.BaselineProfileGenerator
```

## Localization

The UI ships in **English** and **Hindi** (`values-hi`). All copy lives in
`strings.xml`; adding a language is a single `values-<code>/strings.xml`
file — contributions welcome.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for:

- Build flavor system explained
- Code style guide
- Pull request process
- Issue reporting guidelines

Contributions must carry a **copyright assignment**. This is not a formality
under AGPL: it is what keeps the project relicensable as a whole. The 0.1.1
relicensing from Apache-2.0 was only possible because there was a single
copyright holder, and that stops being true the moment a second person
contributes. If you would rather not assign copyright, open an issue describing
your idea instead — it costs you nothing and the work still gets done.

**First-time contributors**: Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`.

**Release process**: Every merge to `main` updates a draft release via [Release Drafter](.github/release-drafter.yml), grouping PRs by label. When ready to ship, publish the draft and tag it `vX.Y.Z` — the version is auto-bumped based on the highest priority label (`breaking` → major, `enhancement`/`feature` → minor, `bug`/`fix` → patch).

### Why AGPL rather than Apache-2.0

AuraSpend was Apache-2.0 until 0.1.1. It moved to AGPL-3.0 for one reason: to
make sure that a modified AuraSpend offered to users over a network has to offer
its source too. Apache-2.0 permits exactly that — a proprietary hosted fork is
lawful — and AGPL-3.0 section 13 does not.

See [ADR 0009](docs/adr/0009-agpl-3.0-relicensing.md) for the full reasoning,
including what AGPL does *not* buy this project.

### Third-party components

AuraSpend bundles or downloads work under other licenses. These remain under
their own terms — the AGPL covers AuraSpend's own source, not theirs:
