## On-Device AI (Local Categorization)

AuraSpend can run a small, fully-on-device model to improve message
auto-categorization into **subscriptions, categories, income, expense and other**.

- **22 MB, not 400 MB.** The model is a quantised `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` sentence
  **encoder** (int8, ONNX), Apache-2.0 licensed. Downloaded at runtime from
  HuggingFace after user consent, and SHA-256 verified before it is allowed
  anywhere near the models directory.
- **Why an encoder, not a language model.** The job is a closed-vocabulary
  decision over a bank SMS, not text generation. Five runtimes were measured
  through the production pipeline; a 468 MB Qwen-0.5B decoder *deleted* 8 of 46
  real transactions because it mistook them for OTPs, and the 22 MB encoder
  deletes **none**. The measured table is in
  [`docs/evals/README.md`](docs/evals/README.md).
- **Consent first**: the first time you open **Smart Add**, the app offers to add
  the categoriser (a 22 MB download, so it is an inline offer rather than a modal
  dialog). Accepting starts a **background download** (resumable, cancellable) to
  internal storage — nothing leaves the device.
- **Progress everywhere**: the download progress is shown **in-app** (Smart Add banner + Settings card) **and in a
  system notification** that updates live and clears when the download finishes.
- **A gap-filler, never a gatekeeper**: amount / merchant / date come from the
  battle-tested regex parser (`BankMessageParser`), and the model fills only the
  gaps it left — *subscription detection, category selection, income-vs-expense*.
  On any conflict the parser's answer wins. A model may never discard a
  transaction on its own: `AiSignalFusion` requires both a calibrated probability
  *and* that the parser found no amount, because a false veto **deletes** a real
  debit rather than mis-filing it. If the model isn't downloaded, the app
  transparently falls back to the pure regex classifier, so nothing breaks.
- **Sender-routed bank parsers**: the SMS sender ID selects a hand-written parser
  for that bank's exact format (Axis, Canara, SBI), which is what resolves
  messages carrying both a real amount and a decoy available-limit figure.
- **Unreadable messages are surfaced, not dropped**: a bank SMS carrying an amount
  and a movement word that no parser can read is recorded so it can be filed by
  hand, rather than silently vanishing from your history.
- **Learned classification memory**: every save (manual or auto) records a normalized
  merchant/note → category mapping in a local Room table (`classification_memory`). Repeat
  merchants are categorized **instantly** — the LLM is skipped entirely — and your manual
  corrections always win over automated suggestions. Stored in `classification_memory`, migrated
  safely from previous schema versions (v5 → v6).
- **Multi-signal fusion** (`AiSignalFusion`): an explicit LLM "not a transaction" verdict vetoes
  false positives; explicit *credited/debited* keywords beat an LLM type guess on conflict;
  recurring-payment keywords (auto-debit, NACH, renewal…) force subscription classification even
  without AI; confidence rises when signals agree and drops when they conflict.
- **Manage it**: the **Smart categories** card in Settings shows status and lets
  you download, cancel and delete the model.

### Build prerequisites

No native toolchain is needed. Inference runs on **ONNX Runtime**, a Maven AAR
rather than a compiled C++ module, so a stock JDK and the Android SDK are
sufficient — the NDK/CMake requirement of earlier releases is gone along with
`llama-lib/`.

### Toolchain

| Component | Version |
|-----------|---------|
| Gradle    | 9.5.0   |
| AGP       | 9.3.1 (built-in Kotlin, KGP 2.2.10) |
| Kotlin / Compose compiler | 2.2.10 |
| compileSdk / targetSdk    | 37 |
| minSdk    | 30 |
| R8        | Full mode (minify + optimize + obfuscate + resource shrinking) |

```bash
# no submodule to fetch - the native runtime is a Maven AAR
./gradlew assembleFreeDebug
```

The model is Apache-2.0 licensed (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`). It is downloaded at
runtime from HuggingFace after user consent, and its SHA-256 is verified before
use.

## Build Flavors

| Flavor | Command | Use Case |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `free` | `./gradlew assembleFreeDebug` | Development, self-build, F-Droid |
| `play` | `./gradlew assemblePlayDebug` | Play Store release |

**Every feature is available in both flavors, and neither build carries
analytics or ads.** AuraSpend has no paywall, no tracking and no ad SDKs — the
claim that your bank SMS never leaves your phone is true of every build we
publish.

The flavors separate *distribution* only: signing, listing metadata, and a
distribution-specific permission if one is ever needed. **No feature may live in
`app/src/play/` that is absent from `app/src/main/`** — see
[ADR 0007](docs/adr/0007-no-paywall.md) and
[ADR 0008](docs/adr/0008-distribution-flavors.md).

### Building a release

```bash
./gradlew assembleFreeRelease    # F-Droid / self-build
./gradlew assemblePlayRelease    # Play Store
```

Release builds require a keystore in `secrets.properties` (see
`secrets.properties.example`). **Without it the build still succeeds but
produces an `…-unsigned.apk`**, which both F-Droid and the Play Store will
reject — check the filename before uploading.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Kotlin
- **UI**: Jetpack Compose + Material 3 (Expressive), Aurora design system (`ui/designsystem`)
- **Typography**: Plus Jakarta Sans (bundled, variable) with tabular figures for money
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture + MVI (Unidirectional data flow)
- **DI**: Manual (Application class) — no Hilt/Koin
- **Local Storage**: Room Database (indexed; SQL aggregates; Paging 3)
- **Charts**: Canvas-based, animated (no external charting library)
- **Cloud**: Google Drive API v3
- **Localization**: English + Hindi (`values-hi`), full string resources
- **Performance**: baseline-profile-ready, Macrobenchmark module (`:benchmark`)
- **Target SDK**: Android 17 (API 37)
- **Min SDK**: Android 11 (API 30)

```

The `free` and `play` source sets deliberately contain **no Kotlin**. Every
feature lives in `main`, so the two published builds are identical — see
[ADR 0008](docs/adr/0008-distribution-flavors.md).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio Koala or newer
- JDK 17+
- Android SDK 36

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/auraspend/auraspend.git
cd auraspend
cp secrets.properties.example secrets.properties
```

Edit `secrets.properties` with:
- **WEB_CLIENT_ID**: Google OAuth 2.0 client ID for Drive sync
- **DRIVE_API_KEY**: Google Drive API key (optional)

Build and run:

```bash
./gradlew assembleFreeDebug
```

**First launch**: The app auto-seeds 12 default categories and shows the onboarding screen.

## Preview

| Home | Quick Add | Activity |
|---|---|---|
| ![Home](docs/screenshots/home-light.png) | ![Quick Add](docs/screenshots/quick-add.png) | ![Activity](docs/screenshots/activity.png) |

| Transaction detail | Insights | Savings goals |

| Onboarding | Dark theme | AMOLED settings |
|---|---|---|
| ![Onboarding](docs/screenshots/onboarding.png) | ![Home dark](docs/screenshots/home-dark.png) | ![Settings](docs/screenshots/settings.png) |

The UI is built on the **Aurora design system** (`app/src/main/java/com/awbuilds/auraspend/ui/designsystem`):
brand purple + lavender + teal, Plus Jakarta Sans with tabular figures, hairline
borders instead of shadows, spring motion tokens and a light / dark / true-black
AMOLED theme. Screenshots are from the `free` debug build.

## Testing

```bash
# Unit tests (JVM) — includes Robolectric + Roborazzi screenshot tests
./gradlew testFreeDebugUnitTest

# Aurora screenshot baselines live in app/src/test/screenshots and are
# regenerated by the test run; CI fails if they change without being committed.

# Instrumented tests (requires emulator/device)
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest

# Cold-start macrobenchmark (release-like build, requires a device)
./gradlew :benchmark:connectedFreeBenchmarkAndroidTest

# Generate a baseline profile (requires a device; copy the produced
# baseline-prof.txt to app/src/main/baseline-prof.txt and commit)
./gradlew :benchmark:connectedFreeBenchmarkAndroidTest \
  -Pandroid.testInstrumentationRunnerArguments.class=com.awbuilds.auraspend.benchmark.BaselineProfileGenerator
```

## Localization

The UI ships in **English** and **Hindi** (`values-hi`). All copy lives in
`strings.xml`; adding a language is a single `values-<code>/strings.xml`
file — contributions welcome.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for:

- Build flavor system explained
- Code style guide
- Pull request process
- Issue reporting guidelines

**First-time contributors**: Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`.

**Release process**: Every merge to `main` updates a draft release via [Release Drafter](.github/release-drafter.yml), grouping PRs by label. When ready to ship, publish the draft and tag it `vX.Y.Z` — the version is auto-bumped based on the highest priority label (`breaking` → major, `enhancement`/`feature` → minor, `bug`/`fix` → patch).
