## What this project is

AuraSpend is an offline-first personal finance app for Android (Kotlin + Jetpack
Compose). It classifies bank SMS on-device (regex + optional on-device LLM),
tracks expenses/budgets/subscriptions/goals, and backs up to Google Drive.
Apache-2.0, open source.

## Current phase

**On-device AI: a 22 MB encoder, not a generator** — latest is
`docs/handoffs/0013-encoder-runtime.md`. The runtime is `EmbeddingClassifier`
(nearest-centroid over cosine, ONNX Runtime, 22 MB int8 MiniLM), which replaced
a 468 MB Qwen/llama.cpp. Five runtimes were measured; the measured table is in
`docs/evals/README.md` and the reasoning in 0011–0013. Before that:
`0010-ui-revamp.md`.
Money is locale/currency-correct (explicit lakh-crore grouping), all hardcoded
font sizes are on the Material 3 scale, `SYSTEM` theme is the default, AMOLED has
its own semantic colours, there is an error state, all 12 screens carry heading
semantics, EN/hi have full key parity, and the design-system rules are enforced
by `DesignSystemGuardTest` + `ErrorStateWiringTest`. `ClassificationScreen` is
split into three files. Whole-screen visual regression covers `DashboardScreen`
in all three themes. Before that: `0009-crash-paths-and-safety-nets.md`
(crash paths, atomic restore, release signing, CI safety nets), then
`0006`–`0008`. Remaining work is in 0010 §4 — wire `AuraErrorState` into screens,
fold the hand-rolled stat grids onto `AuraStatTile`, split `ClassificationScreen`.
Do not start new work without reading the latest handoff.

## Module map

| Module | What lives there |
|---|---|
| `:app` | Everything (UI, domain, data) |
| `:benchmark` | Macrobenchmark module for cold-start and baseline-profile generation. Not shipped, not part of the app. |

On-device inference is ONNX Runtime (an AAR, not a module). The `:llama` module
and the `third_party/llama.cpp` submodule were removed in handoff 0013 along with
the Qwen GGUF they served.

Kotlin source root: `app/src/main/java/com/awbuilds/auraspend/`

| Package | Contents |
|---|---|
| `core/` | Cross-cutting helpers (`AuraLog`, boundaries) |
| `data/` | Room, classification pipeline, AI, Drive, privacy |
| `domain/` | Models, repository interface, use cases |
| `ui/designsystem/` | Aurora tokens + reusable components (**use these**) |
| `ui/theme/` | Color palette, typography, shapes, `AuraSpendTheme` |
| `ui/<feature>/` | Feature screens (home, transaction, classification, …) |

## Commands

```bash
./gradlew :app:compileProdDebugKotlin     # fast compile check
./gradlew testProdDebugUnitTest           # unit tests (required before handoff)
./gradlew :app:lintProdDebug               # new issues fail; 78 pre-existing baselined
./gradlew assembleDevDebug                # dev APK (fast inner loop)
./gradlew assembleProdDebug               # prod APK (what ships; native build)
```

Flavors: `dev` (development — `.dev` application id, "AuraSpend Dev" label) and
`prod` (the only distributed build). Feature-identical; see ADR 0010.
The Play paywall was removed in Phase 0 — do not reintroduce premium gating.

**Signed releases:** keystore credentials live in `secrets.properties`
(gitignored, see `secrets.properties.example`). Without them `assembleProdRelease`
still succeeds but produces `app-prod-release-unsigned.apk` and logs a warning —
check the filename before calling a release build shippable.

**Lint:** `app/lint-baseline.xml` pins the 78 pre-existing issues so only *new*
ones fail CI. Run `./gradlew updateLintBaseline` deliberately (and review the
diff) when you intentionally fix or add lint suppressions.

## Hard requirements (non-negotiable)

1. **Errors never crash the UI.** Every IO/platform boundary (Room, network,
   Drive, LLM, CSV, SMS, WorkManager) must catch its exceptions, log via
   `AuraLog`, and degrade to a typed fallback/error state. Never write an empty
   `catch {}`. Always rethrow `CancellationException`. Use the `boundary { }` /
   `boundaryOrNull { }` helpers from `core/AuraLog.kt` for new code.
   **Never put a raw exception message in screen state** — log the cause, then
   report a `UiError` (`ui/core/UiError.kt`) and resolve the string from
   resources. `ErrorStateWiringTest` fails the build if a screen declares an
   `error` field it never renders.
2. **No `!!` in new code.** No `lateinit` where a constructor/`requireNotNull`
   with a real error path works.
3. **Handoff discipline.** Every session ends with a `docs/handoffs/NNNN-*.md`
   entry: what changed, decisions made, verification evidence (commands +
   results), open risks, next step. Every session starts by reading the latest
   handoff.
4. **Memory discipline.** Keep `CLAUDE.md` as a ≤100-line hot cache. Durable
   knowledge (decisions, glossary, project state) goes to `memory/`.
   **Never regress the OTP/alert filter.** `SmsAutoClassifier.isOtpOrAlertMessage`
   must skip an OTP only when the message has no amount *and* no movement verb —
   a real debit that ends in an OTP code is a real transaction, and dropping it
   loses the user's money silently. The hard fraud veto deliberately has *no*
   rescue, because a phishing lure parses identically to a genuine debit.
5. **Design system discipline.** Screens use `ui/designsystem` components and
   `ui/theme` tokens. No raw hex colors, no one-off `fontSize =`, no
   `Modifier.shadow` on content surfaces, no new emoji in chrome. New shared
   UI belongs in `ui/designsystem`, not in a screen file. **These are enforced by
   `DesignSystemGuardTest`** — they fail the build, so a violation is a red test
   rather than a review comment. Touch targets ≥48dp; anything holding text uses
   `heightIn`, not a fixed `height`, so it survives 200% font scale.
6. **Green build.** `:app:compileProdDebugKotlin` and `testProdDebugUnitTest`
   must pass before a handoff. Never commit red.
7. **Branching.** `main` is release-ready, protected and default; day-to-day
   work lands on `dev`. Work branches are short-lived and come off `dev`:
   `phase-N-name` for a planned phase, otherwise `<type>/<topic>` with
   `feat|fix|chore|docs|perf|refactor`. Delete a branch once merged; merge
   `dev` into `main` for a release. Small commits, conventional commit
   subjects (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `perf:`, `refactor:`).
8. **Compiler warnings are triage items, not noise.** Read every `w:` line in
   a build before moving on. Two user-visible bugs in this project were caused
   by deprecation warnings that were present in a green build and read past
   twice: `rememberSwipeToDismissBoxState(confirmValueChange = ...)` is
   *deprecated without replacement*, so the callback stopped being called
   entirely — swipe-to-save and swipe-to-delete both became silent no-ops that
   still animated and still showed their coloured backgrounds, so the UI looked
   alive while doing nothing. A warning that says "deprecated without
   replacement" is a behaviour change, not a style note. Fix it, suppress it
   with a written reason, or record why it is safe — never just scroll past.
   `./gradlew :app:compileProdDebugKotlin --rerun-tasks 2>&1 | grep "^w:"` lists
   them.
9. **AuraSpend is AGPL-3.0-or-later. Do not weaken the copyleft.** The project
   relicensed from Apache-2.0 in 0.1.1 (ADR 0009). Two things follow, and both
   are easy to violate by accident:
   - **A new dependency must be AGPL-3.0-compatible.** Everything currently in
     the graph is Apache-2.0 or MIT, which flows one-way into AGPLv3. A GPL-2.0-
     only or non-commercial dependency would make the app undistributable, so
     check the candidate's licence *when it is proposed*, not at merge time.
     Apache-2.0 and MIT are fine.
   - **Never strip the notice.** A derivative work must keep the notices and add
     its own statement of modification (AGPL §4/§5). `docs/terms.html` used to
     carry an Apache-era clause forbidding reverse engineering; that clause was
     **removed** because AGPL §3 forbids anti-circumvention restrictions, and it
     must not come back. The trademark paragraph is separate and does stand.
   Run `./tools/check_license.sh` after touching anything licence-adjacent. It
   fails if the licence string is inconsistent across `LICENSE`, `README`, both
   string locales, the splash footer, the website and the legal pages, or if a
   dependency has no third-party attribution. The licence had silently drifted
   across eleven files before that check existed, so it is worth trusting it over
   your memory of where the licence is mentioned. **A mention of "Apache-2.0"
   about a dependency is correct and must not be "fixed"** — the bundled font is
   OFL, ONNX Runtime is MIT, Lottie and AndroidX and the Google libraries are
   Apache-2.0, and the runtime-downloaded model is Apache-2.0. A global
   find-and-replace makes false licensing claims about third parties.

## Design system quick reference

| Need | Use |
|---|---|
| Card | `AuraCard` (`Filled` / `Tonal` / `Outlined` / `Glass`) |
| Money text (animated) | `AnimatedMoney` + `AuraType.money*` |
| Category badge | `CategoryAvatar` |
| Filter/range selector | `AuraSegmentedControl` |
| Progress / donut / area | `AuraProgressRing`, `AuraDonutChart`, `AuraAreaChart` |
| Loading placeholder | `AuraSkeleton` |
| Empty state | `AuraEmptyState` |
| Error / retry state (no data to show) | `AuraErrorState` |
| Inline error banner (data still visible) | `AuraErrorBanner` |
| Metric tile (label + value) | `AuraStatTile` (`contained = false` inside a card) |
| Money text | `formatMoney` (locale-aware) / `AnimatedMoney` |
| Spacing | `AuraSpacing.*` (4dp grid, `gutter = 20dp`) |
| Motion | `AuraMotion.*` (never invent durations) |
| Brand gradient | `AuraGradients.aurora` |

Legacy `ui/core/CashewComponents.kt` is a Phase 0 compatibility shim. Do not
add new usage; migrate call sites to the design system as each screen is
rebuilt (P1–P3), then delete the shim.

## Money, theme and i18n invariants

- **Never hardcode a currency symbol or a locale.** Use `formatMoney` /
  `formatMoneyCompact` from `ui/designsystem/Money.kt`. Indian lakh/crore
  grouping is implemented by hand on purpose — `NumberFormat` and `#,##,##0` both
  return *Western* grouping for `en_IN`/`hi_IN` on this project's JDK, so
  reverting to the platform formatter reintroduces a real bug.
- **Currency comes from the theme** (`LocalCurrencyStyle` / `MoneyConfig`), set
  from the `currency_code` preference and defaulting to the device locale. Do
  not thread a currency parameter through call sites.
- **`AppThemeMode.SYSTEM` is the default.** Parse preferences with
  `AppThemeMode.fromName`, never `valueOf`, which throws on a corrupt value.
- **Every user-facing string needs both `values/` and `values-hi/`.** Key parity
  is checked; a new string without its Hindi twin is a defect.
- **Localize `contentDescription`.** Hardcoded English in chrome is untranslatable.
- **Apostrophes in `strings.xml` must be escaped as `\'`** (Android syntax).
  A bare `'` or a `&#39;` entity fails the resource build with a misleading
  "Invalid unicode escape sequence" error.

## Storage and restore invariants

- **Never write to public/external storage.** `minSdk = 30` forbids it without
  `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`; use the Storage Access Framework uri directly
  (see `CsvManager.exportToCsv`).
- **Drive restore is a replace, not a merge**, and it runs inside one
  `BackupRestoreManager` Room transaction. Do not "restore" by calling repository
  save methods directly from a composable.
- **`BackupData` must carry every user-owned table** (transactions, categories,
  budgets, subscriptions, SMS queue, savings goals, classification memory).
  Format is v3; deserialization must stay tolerant of missing/legacy fields.
- **Auto Backup is off for the DB.** `res/xml/backup_rules.xml` and
  `data_extraction_rules.xml` exclude `auraspend_db`, prefs and the model
  directory; keep them that way — the app promises data stays on-device.
- **Every write path goes through `TransactionRepositoryImpl.sanitized()`**, the
  single `SensitiveDataMasker` choke-point. New write paths must not bypass it.

## On-device AI invariants

- **The runtime seam is `OnDeviceClassifier`** (`data/ai/OnDeviceClassifier.kt`),
  which describes the *job*, not a mechanism: `extract(smsBody, categoryIdByName)
  -> SmsExtraction?`. Do not widen it back to prompt-in/text-out — a
  grammar-constrained runtime has no meaningful "prompt", and its parse guarantee
  and calibrated score cannot cross such an interface. `LocalLlmProvider` is the
  only place a backend is chosen, and `UnavailableClassifier` is the only
  degradation path.
- **`SmsExtraction.confidence` is nullable and must stay honest.** null means
  the runtime has no calibrated head. Never fabricate a score.
- **Any new runtime must beat the measured floor, *fused*.** Baseline with the
  model switched off: **13.8 % exact match**, type 95.4 %, category 36.9 %
  (`RegexBaselineEval`, `./gradlew :app:classificationBaseline`).
  `RegexBaselineEvalTest` fails if the regex layer regresses. A model that beats
  that floor *standalone* may still be worse in the pipeline — Qwen and
  SmolLM2 both score 29.2 % standalone and reached opposite conclusions. Judge
  every candidate with `FusedAiEval`.
- **The `dev`/`prod` flavors are feature-identical.** No feature may live in a
  flavor source set that is absent from `app/src/main/`; only configuration
  (application-id suffix, label, signing) may differ. **Neither build may carry
  analytics, ads or any telemetry** — the app's on-screen claim is that bank SMS
  never leaves the device, and an SDK in one build would make that claim false
  and the store listing self-contradictory. There is no paywall and no in-app
  purchase; every feature ships in every build. Do not reintroduce premium
  gating (ADR 0007), and do not add a Play-only capability without superseding
  ADR 0010.
- **A model may never delete a transaction on a bare boolean.** A model "not a
  transaction" verdict nulls `amount` and `type` in `AiSignalFusion`, and the
  pipeline's unresolved-fields gate then drops the row — so a false veto
  *deletes* a real debit rather than mis-filing it. Measured rates of that
  failure: 43/46 (SmolLM2), 8/46 (Qwen2.5-0.5B), 5/46 (FunctionGemma-270M),
  **0/46 (the shipped encoder)**. `mayDiscard` requires **both**
  `isTransactionProbability >= 0.9` **and** `base.amount == null`; confidence
  alone is not enough, because the regex layer reading a message correctly is
  the stronger signal. A runtime that cannot supply a probability reports `null`
  and keeps the old behaviour — never fabricate one, since a higher probability
  is licence to discard. This is also the reason to prefer a **non-generative**
  classifier here: an encoder emits no text, so it cannot fabricate the verdict
  in the first place.
- **Classify by sender first.** The SMS sender ID is free, reliable routing
  metadata (`BankParserRegistry.parserFor`). Per-bank parsers live in
  `data/classification/bank/`. `CanaraBankParser` must never read the
  `Dial 1930 to report cyber fraud` footer — it decorates every genuine Canara
  debit. A message no parser claims but that carries an amount and a movement
  verb goes to the `unrecognized_sms` table, never silently into the bin.
- **Model downloads are SHA-256 verified** against a pinned digest in
  `ModelConstants` before the file is moved into place. A size check alone cannot
  detect a corrupt or substituted file, and the model is executed on-device.
- **A prebuilt native library must pass `tools/audit_native_runtime.sh`**
  (no network imports, no service URLs, no `dlopen`, no telemetry vendor
  strings) before it is wired in, and the audit must be re-run on every version
  bump — a pass is only valid for the digest it was run against. Two traps it
  must keep avoiding, both of which silently produce a meaningless result:
  POSIX ERE has **no word boundary**, so `grep -E '\b'` matches a backspace and
  finds nothing; and a release `.so` is usually **stripped**, so `nm` returns
  empty and the scan reads nothing at all. The script now falls back to `nm -D`,
  validates that it found symbols *before* reporting a clean result, and filters
  documentation URLs (arXiv, scipy, NVIDIA docs) and mangled C++ names containing
  "Telemetry" — a real library embeds both, and flagging them would train people
  to ignore the check. ONNX Runtime arm64 passes with zero network imports.
