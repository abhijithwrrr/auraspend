/**
 * Runs the golden corpus through the *production* pipeline with a recorded
 * model's output in the loop, and prints the report.
 *
 * This is the measurement that decides model questions, and it is the one that
 * had never been run. `RegexBaselineEval` measures the floor with no AI;
 * `tools/gguf_eval.py` measures a model in isolation. Neither is what a user
 * gets, because `AiSignalFusion` gives a model one dangerous power — a "not a
 * transaction" verdict wipes amount and type — and gives it no power at all on
 * any other conflict.
 *
 * Not an assertion-bearing test on the model numbers: a model's score is a
 * measurement, not a contract, and pinning it would turn a tuning decision into
 * a red build. What *is* asserted is the harness's own correctness — the
 * null-model path must reproduce `RegexBaselineEval` exactly, or every number
 * derived from it is untrustworthy.
