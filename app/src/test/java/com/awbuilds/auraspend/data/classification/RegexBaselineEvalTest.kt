/**
 * Establishes the accuracy floor: what the app does with the model switched off.
 *
 * The thresholds are anchored to the baseline **measured on 2026-09-29** (13.8%
 * exact match), not to a guess. The point is not that the app is accurate — at
 * 13.8% exact match it plainly is not — but that any future runtime now has a
 * number to beat, and any change to the parser has a number that must not move
 * without a deliberate decision.
 *
 * Exact match is a deliberately harsh metric here: two of the five scored fields
 * (amount, date) are not even in the model's schema, because the regex layer owns
 * them. The per-field breakdown is the readable signal; see
 * [ClassificationEval.Report.format].
