 * A user-facing failure reason.

 * ViewModels used to set `error = e.message` straight into screen state, so a user
 * could be shown `SQLiteConstraintException: UNIQUE constraint failed ...` or a
 * bare "Failed to save" in English. That is both unlocalized and technically
 * meaningless to the person looking at their bank balance.
 *
 * The ViewModel now reports *what* went wrong and logs the cause; the composable
 * resolves the message from resources at render time, which keeps the copy
 * localizable and testable.
