/**
 * Maps an SMS sender ID to the parser that knows that bank's format.
 *
 * Sender ID is the one piece of routing metadata the app receives for free and
 * reliably: it is delivered with the message, costs nothing to read, and is
 * stable. The golden corpus did not capture it until now, which is why
 * sender-routed parsing had never been measurable in this project.
 *
 * Returning null is a normal, expected outcome, not a failure. Most users bank
 * with at least one institution not in [all], and the caller must fall back to
 * the global parser rather than guess.
