/**
 * Deterministic merchant → category lookup, used to fill category gaps.
 *
 * The model is not the right tool for this. The golden corpus shows it: the
 * shipped Qwen2.5-0.5B reaches 36.9 % category accuracy *through the regex
 * layer alone* and its own output was well-formed but wrong — returning
 * amounts, card numbers and bank names as merchants. A merchant name like
 * "Swiggy" or "BigBasket" is a closed, enumerable vocabulary problem, and
 * solving it with a word-bounded keyword scan is both more accurate and
 * auditable.
 *
 * Word boundaries are load-bearing, not decoration. `CLAUDE.md` records that
 * substring-unsafe keys ("fee", "credit", "vi") caused real misfiling, so
 * every key here is matched as a whole word or phrase. Longest key wins, so
 * "amazon prime" beats "amazon".
 *
 * This map only ever *fills a gap*. It must never override a category the
 * parser or the user already resolved.
