/**
 * One bank's SMS formats, hand-written.
 *
 * A per-bank parser exists because a bank's transaction message carries several
 * amounts and several near-miss tokens, and only that bank's own format
 * disambiguates them. The golden corpus's Axis case is the clearest example:
 *
 * ```
 * Spent INR 25
 * Axis Bank Card
 * no. XX9054
 * 16-08-26 11:33:30 IST
 * Yasar
 * Avl Limit: INR 48058.57
 * ```
 *
 * There are two amounts, a card number that looks like an id, a timestamp, and
 * the merchant sitting between the timestamp and a balance line that a naive
 * "last amount wins" heuristic picks up instead. A single global regex has to
 * resolve all of that; a parser that knows the message is Axis, and knows the
 * Axis layout, does not.
 *
 * This is the same idea as `sarim2000/pennywiseai-tracker`'s per-bank parser
 * registry (which routes 200+ banks this way and uses no LLM in its SMS
 * pipeline at all). That project is AGPL-3.0, so nothing here is copied from
 * it — the routing shape is learned, the code is ours.
