/**
 * Central configuration for the on-device model used for message categorisation.
 *
 * **This class is the model-swap seam.** The runtime and the weights are
 * independent: swapping either must never require touching the prompt, the
 * parser, or the fusion rules.
 *
 * The current model is [EmbeddingClassifier]'s — an int8 quantised
 * `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` encoder at **22 MiB**, replacing a 468.6 MiB Qwen2.5-0.5B
 * GGUF that ran through llama.cpp. That is a **21x reduction** in what a
 * consenting user downloads, and the reason is architectural rather than a
 * quantisation trick: the job is a closed-vocabulary classification over SMS
 * text, not text generation, so an encoder is the right shape and a decoder LM
 * was always over-provisioned for it.
 *
 * The accuracy case, measured through the production pipeline
 * (`FusedAiEval`, 65-case golden corpus) rather than the model in isolation:
 *
 * | runtime            | size   | exact  | false vetoes |
 * |--------------------|--------|--------|--------------|
 * | SmolLM2-135M       | 100 MB | 29.2 % | 43 / 46      |
 * | FunctionGemma-270M | 241 MB | 24.6 % |  5 / 46      |
 * | Qwen2.5-0.5B       | 468 MB | 29.2 % |  8 / 46      |
 * | MiniLM-L6 (here)   | 22 MB  | 18.5 % |  1 / 46      |
 *
 * A "false veto" is a real transaction the model called "not a transaction".
 * `AiSignalFusion` nulls `amount` and `type` on that verdict and the pipeline
 * drops the row, so the error *deletes* a transaction rather than mis-filing it.
 * That is why the veto number, not the exact-match number, is the one that
 * decided this swap — and why an encoder that cannot fabricate a verdict is
 * preferable at a fifth of the size.
