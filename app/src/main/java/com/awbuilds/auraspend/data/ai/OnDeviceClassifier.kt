     * A bare boolean cannot express doubt, and that turned out to matter more

     * is deleted rather than mis-filed. Measured on the golden corpus, a model
     * answered "not a transaction" for 7 of 46 real transactions (Qwen2.5-0.5B)
     * and 40 of 46 (SmolLM2-135M) — destroying 7 and 40 respectively to rescue
     * 1 and 0. A model that is 0.4 sure must not be able to do that; a model
     * that is 0.99 sure still may not, because the regex layer reading the
     * message correctly is the stronger signal.
     *
     * llama.cpp cannot supply this — a GGUF generation has no calibrated head —
     * so the shipped model reports null and behaviour is unchanged. A
     * grammar-constrained runtime that reads probabilities can fill it, and
     * becomes safe to trust. Until then null is the honest answer.
