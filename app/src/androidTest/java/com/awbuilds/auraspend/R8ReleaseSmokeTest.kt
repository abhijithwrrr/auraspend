/**
 * Device tests for the JNI and Room paths — the two that cannot be exercised on
 * the JVM.
 *
 * Run with:
 * ```
 * ./gradlew :app:connectedFreeDebugAndroidTest
 * ```
 *
 * ## What this does and does not cover
 *
 * This runs against the **debug** build. It covers the native library load, a
 * real encoder inference, and Room's generated code on a real device — none of
 * which Robolectric can do.
 *
 * It deliberately does **not** claim to cover R8. Targeting the minified
 * `benchmark` build type needs `testBuildType`, and that flag renames the
 * *unit* test task too: `testFreeDebugUnitTest` disappears and is replaced by
 * `testFreeBenchmarkUnitTest`, which would run all 253 unit tests — screenshot
 * baselines included — against a shrunk build. That trades the documented gate
 * and CI for nothing, so it was reverted.
 *
 * The R8 question is therefore answered statically instead, by
 * `tools/verify_r8_release.sh`, which checks the release `mapping.txt` for the
 * classes ONNX Runtime resolves by name at `JNI_OnLoad`. That is
 * deterministic, needs no device, and is a stronger answer to the specific R8
 * risk than "the app launched and nothing obvious broke".
 *
 * ## The assertion that matters
 *
 * The obvious version of a test like this — "nothing threw" — would pass even
 * if the encoder were completely dead. `LocalLlmProvider.build()` catches
 * `UnsatisfiedLinkError` and every `Throwable`, logs, and returns
 * `UnavailableClassifier`, and `EmbeddingClassifier` routes each of its
 * initialisation steps through `boundaryOrNull`. So a total JNI failure
 * degrades to the regex classifier *silently*: no crash, no exception, a
 * working-looking app that has quietly lost its AI path.
 *
 * Every test below therefore asserts that work actually **happened** — a
 * non-null extraction, a populated probability — rather than that it didn't
 * crash. `assertNotNull` on the result is the load-bearing line.
 *
 * ## Model provisioning
 *
 * The encoder weights are downloaded at runtime, not bundled, so a fresh
 * install has no model and the test would have nothing to run. The test
 * provisions it itself, over the same URL and against the same pinned SHA-256
 * digests that `ModelDownloadManager` uses, so it exercises the real
 * download-and-verify path rather than trusting a sideloaded file. If the
 * download or the digest check fails, the test **fails loudly** rather than
 * skipping: a skip would be indistinguishable from the silent degradation this
 * class exists to catch.
